What the script does
--------------------

Use class ReadGridded to import results from ECMWF CAMS reanalysis for the years 2003-2007 (5 years), variable od550aer in daily resolution. After reading the files, the global weighted mean time series is calculated as well as a time series over the city of Leipzig is retrieved using neirest neighbour interpolation.
